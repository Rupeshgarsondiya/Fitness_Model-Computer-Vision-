# AI-Powered Fitness Pose Estimation for Exercise Tracking

This repository contains a **Computer Vision-based Fitness Trainer** that leverages **AI-powered pose estimation** to track and analyze exercise movements in real time.  

Using **OpenCV** for data processing and **MediaPipe Pose Estimation**, this model detects body landmarks and provides feedback on exercise performance.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Pose Tracking** with **MediaPipe Pose Estimation**  
- **Exercise Recognition & Analysis** for the following movements:  
  1. 🏋️‍♂️ **Dumbbell Forearm Curl**  
  2. 🏋️ **Arm Raises**  
  3. 💪 **Side Arm Raise**  
  4. 🏃‍♂️ **Squats**  
  5. 🤸‍♂️ **Backward Lunge**  
- **Computer Vision-Based AI Trainer** for posture correction  
- **OpenCV for Data Processing & Frame Analysis**  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for frame processing)  
- **MediaPipe Pose Estimation** (for landmark detection)  
- **NumPy** (for mathematical operations)
